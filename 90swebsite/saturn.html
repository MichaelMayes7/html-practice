                The Sega Saturn is a home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994, in Japan, May 11, 1995, 
                in North America, and July 8, 1995, in Europe.
                 Part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, it was the successor to the successful Sega Genesis. 
                 The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. 
                 Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several ports of arcade games as well as original games.
                Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. 
                The Saturn was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi. 
                Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation.

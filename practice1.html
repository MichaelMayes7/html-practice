            <span>This exercise is about making lists</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>Here's what i like about making lists:</span>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                <li>That's about it</li>
                <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things int three's is cool</li>
            </ul>
            <span>When you make a list do it in this order:</span>
            <br />
            <ol>
                <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                    <ol>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</ol>
                </ul>
                <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ol>

                <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
